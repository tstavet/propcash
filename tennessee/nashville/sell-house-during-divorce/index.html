    <h2 style="font-size: clamp(28px, 5vw, 36px); margin-bottom: 32px; text-align: center;">Divorce Home Sale FAQs</h2>
    
    <details>
      <summary>Can you buy our Nashville home if we're going through a divorce?</summary>
      <p class="sub">Yes! We regularly work with divorcing couples in Nashville who need to sell their marital home quickly. We understand the sensitivity of your situation and can work with both parties (or their attorneys) to ensure a fair, transparent transaction. We've helped dozens of Nashville couples navigate this difficult process.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>How quickly can you close on a divorce property sale in Nashville?</summary>
      <p class="sub">We can close in as little as 7 days, which is often crucial for divorcing couples who need to finalize their separation or meet court deadlines. If you need more time to coordinate moving out or finalizing details, we can close on any timeline that works for both parties.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>What if only one spouse wants to sell the Nashville home?</summary>
      <p class="sub">We can evaluate your situation and provide guidance. Typically, both spouses need to agree to sell if both are on the title. However, Tennessee law allows certain scenarios where a court can order the sale. We recommend consulting with your divorce attorney about your specific circumstances. We're happy to speak with both parties separately if needed.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>How do you handle the proceeds from a divorce home sale?</summary>
      <p class="sub">We work with both parties and their attorneys to ensure proceeds are distributed exactly according to your divorce decree or settlement agreement. We can: split payment between both parties, pay directly to each party's attorney for distribution, follow court-ordered payment instructions, or coordinate with your title company. Everything is transparent and fair.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
      <summary>Do we need to agree on repairs before selling during divorce?</summary>
      <p class="sub">No! This is one of the biggest benefits of selling to us. We buy houses as-is, which eliminates one of the most common sources of conflict during divorce. You don't need to agree on repairs, improvements, staging, or any updates. We buy your Nashville home exactly as it is—saving you both money and arguments.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can we sell if one spouse is still living in the Nashville home?</summary>
      <p class="sub">Yes! We can work around occupancy situations. If one spouse is still living in the home, we'll coordinate the timeline so they have adequate time to move out. We understand divorce situations are delicate and will accommodate both parties' needs.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if we're behind on mortgage payments due to the divorce?</summary>
      <p class="sub">This is common during divorce when finances become strained. We can help you avoid foreclosure by making a quick cash offer. In many cases, we can close fast enough to prevent further damage to both spouses' credit scores. Contact us immediately if you're facing foreclosure—time is critical.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do both spouses need to be present for the home walk-through?</summary>
      <p class="sub">Not necessarily. We can accommodate whatever works best for your situation. Some couples prefer to be there together with their attorneys, while others prefer separate walk-throughs. We're flexible and will work with whatever arrangement makes everyone most comfortable.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do you determine a fair price for our Nashville divorce home?</summary>
      <p class="sub">We use recent comparable sales in your neighborhood, assess your property's condition, factor in needed repairs, and consider current Nashville market trends. We provide a transparent breakdown of how we calculated our offer. Both parties can review the offer independently and discuss with their attorneys. Our goal is a fair deal that helps both spouses move forward.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Will our neighbors know we're selling due to divorce?</summary>
      <p class="sub">No. Unlike traditional listings, there are no yard signs, public listings, or open houses. We keep everything completely confidential. Only you, your attorneys, and our team will know about the sale. We understand privacy is crucial during divorce.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can you buy our rental property that we owned together?</summary>
      <p class="sub">Yes! We buy all types of properties—primary residences, rental properties, vacation homes, or investment properties. If you and your spouse co-owned a rental property in Nashville, we can buy it whether it has tenants or not. No need to wait for leases to expire.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if the home is in only one spouse's name?</summary>
      <p class="sub">Tennessee is an equitable distribution state, which means the home may still be considered marital property even if only one name is on the title. We recommend working with your divorce attorney to clarify ownership rights. Once that's settled, we can move forward with the purchase.</p>
