          When you've lived in a home for 20, 30, or 40 years, maintenance adds up. The roof you meant to replace, the HVAC that's been limping along, the kitchen that's still original. Traditional buyers want move-in ready — but our investors buy homes exactly as they are.

          <h2>Understanding Hermitage's established community</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>A neighborhood built on history and family</h3>
          <p>
            Named after Andrew Jackson's historic plantation just down the road, Hermitage has always been a place where families put down roots. Many homes in the area were built in the 1960s-1980s during Hermitage's suburban expansion, and it's not uncommon for families to have lived in the same house for 30 or 40 years. This stability is what makes Hermitage special — but it also means many homeowners face the challenge of selling a home that hasn't been updated in decades.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Why investors are drawn to Hermitage</h3>
          <p>
            Hermitage offers what investors call "location value" — 15 miles from downtown Nashville, 5 miles from the airport, near Percy Priest Lake, and adjacent to the growing Mt. Juliet market. Properties in established Hermitage neighborhoods, even those needing significant updates, attract strong investor interest because of the area's fundamentals. This demand works in your favor: more investors competing means better offers.
          </p>
          
          <h3>The estate and probate challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Many Hermitage properties come to market through estate sales. Adult children inherit homes their parents lived in for decades — homes that may need significant work, contain a lifetime of belongings, and require coordination among multiple family members. Traditional sales add stress to an already emotional process. Our marketplace simplifies estate sales with as-is purchases, flexible timelines, and experience navigating probate situations.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Selling on your timeline</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Maybe you need to close quickly to coordinate with a move. Maybe you need 90 days to find your next home or settle family affairs. Either way, the marketplace puts you in control. Unlike traditional sales where the buyer dictates timing, our investors work around your schedule. You pick the closing date that makes sense for your situation.

          <h2>Frequently asked questions about selling in Hermitage</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-list">
          <details>
            <summary>We've lived in our Hermitage home for 30+ years. Is this process right for us?</summary>
            <p>Absolutely — and you're exactly who we designed it for. Long-term homeowners often have deferred maintenance, original finishes, and no desire to stage their home for strangers. The marketplace lets you sell as-is, on your timeline, without the stress of traditional listings. Many of our Hermitage sellers have been in their homes for decades.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>What Hermitage areas do you cover?</summary>
            <p>We buy houses throughout all of Hermitage and the 37076 zip code: Hermitage Hills, Hermitage Estates, the Percy Priest Lake area, neighborhoods near Stones River Greenway, the Andrew Jackson corridor, Lebanon Road area, and everywhere in between. We also cover nearby Donelson, Old Hickory, and Mt. Juliet.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>My parents' home is in probate. Can you help?</summary>
            <p>Yes — we work with probate properties regularly. Depending on your situation, we may be able to make offers before probate closes or work with your attorney to close once it's complete. We understand the emotional and logistical complexity of estate sales and can accommodate the unique timelines and requirements involved.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>Our house hasn't been updated since we moved in 30 years ago. Is that a problem?</summary>
            <p>Not at all — it's exactly what investors expect in established Hermitage neighborhoods. Original 1970s-80s kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, and fixtures are standard for the area. Investors build renovation costs into their offers and buy properties exactly as they are. You don't spend a dollar on updates.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>How flexible are you on closing timelines?</summary>
            <p>Completely flexible. Need to close in 7 days? We can do that. Need 60-90 days to find your next home, coordinate a move, or settle family affairs? That works too. Unlike traditional sales where buyers dictate timing, our investors work around your schedule. You tell us what you need.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>We still have a lot of belongings in the house. Do we have to clear it out?</summary>
            <p>Take what you want and leave the rest. Many estate properties and long-term homes have decades of accumulated belongings. Our investors can handle property cleanout as part of their renovation process. You're not required to empty the house before closing.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>Are there really no fees or commissions?</summary>
            <p>Zero. No realtor commissions (typically 5-6% in Nashville), no closing costs, no hidden fees. Propcash is completely free for sellers. The cash offer you accept is exactly what you receive at closing.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>How is Propcash different from "we buy houses" companies?</summary>
            <p>Those companies make you one offer and hope you accept — often a lowball. Propcash is a marketplace that sends your property to 500+ investors who compete for it. As one Hermitage seller told us, the competition made a $55K difference compared to the single-buyer offer they'd received. More buyers = more competition = better offers.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>What happens after I submit my property information?</summary>
            <p>Within 24 hours, your property goes out to our investor network. Interested investors submit offers. Our Marketplace Specialists review all offers and present you with the best options — typically 3-4 for Hermitage properties. You choose which offer to accept (if any), then we coordinate closing on your timeline. There's zero obligation at any step.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>I'm dealing with health issues and need to move to assisted living. Can you help?</summary>
            <p>Yes — and we understand these situations require sensitivity and flexibility. We can work with you, your family, or your power of attorney to make the process as smooth as possible. Fast closings are available if needed, or we can give you time to coordinate care arrangements. Your wellbeing comes first.</p>
