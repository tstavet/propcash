      <p class="sub" style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 40px;">Inheriting real estate often comes with unexpected complications. Here are the most common issues Nashville heirs face:</p>

          <div class="icon-badge">üìã</div>
          <h3>Probate Process Delays</h3>
          <p class="sub">Tennessee probate can take 6-12 months or longer, especially if there are disputes among heirs or creditor claims. During this time, you're paying taxes and utilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="icon-badge">üèöÔ∏è</div>
          <h3>Property in Poor Condition</h3>
          <p class="sub">Many inherited Nashville homes have been neglected or need significant updates. The thought of managing repairs when you're grieving is overwhelming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="icon-badge">üí∞</div>
          <h3>Ongoing Carrying Costs</h3>
          <p class="sub">Property taxes, insurance, utilities, lawn maintenance, and HOA fees add up quickly ‚Äî often $500-$1,500+ per month while the house sits empty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <div class="icon-badge">üìç</div>
          <h3>Property is Out of State</h3>
          <p class="sub">If you live outside Tennessee, managing an inherited Nashville property becomes even more difficult and expensive. Coordinating repairs and showings from afar is a nightmare.</p>
        </div>

          <h3>Multiple Heirs & Disagreements</h3>

          <li><strong>Joint Ownership:</strong> Property owned as "joint tenants with right of survivorship" transfers automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Beneficiary Deed:</strong> Similar to TOD, allows you to name beneficiaries who inherit directly</li>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Good News: Tennessee Has No Inheritance Tax</h3>
        <p class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Tennessee eliminated its inheritance tax in 2016. This means you won't owe any state taxes simply for inheriting property in Nashville.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Federal Estate Tax (Usually Not Applicable)</h3>
        <p class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">The federal estate tax only applies to estates exceeding $13.61 million (2024). Unless your loved one had an extremely large estate, you won't owe federal estate tax.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 16px; margin-top: 32px;">Capital Gains Tax: The Stepped-Up Basis Rule</h3>
        <p class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 16px;">This is the most important tax consideration when selling inherited property:</p>
        
        <div style="background: white; border: 1px solid var(--line); border-radius: 12px; padding: 28px; margin: 24px 0;">
          <p class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>How Stepped-Up Basis Works:</strong></p>
          <ul style="margin: 0 0 0 24px; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text);">
            <li>Your inherited property's "basis" (cost for tax purposes) is "stepped up" to the fair market value on the date of death</li>
            <li>If you sell soon after inheriting, your capital gain is usually minimal or zero</li>
            <li>You only pay capital gains tax on appreciation AFTER the inheritance date</li>
          </ul>

          <div style="background: rgba(107, 68, 35, .04); padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 20px;">
            <p class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <p class="sub" style="margin: 0;">Your parent bought a Nashville home for $150,000 in 1990. It was worth $400,000 when they passed. Your stepped-up basis is $400,000 (not $150,000). If you sell for $410,000, you only pay capital gains on $10,000 ‚Äî not $260,000!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 16px; margin-top: 32px;">Selling Quickly Minimizes Tax Liability</h3>
        <p class="sub" style="margin-bottom: 32px;">The sooner you sell after inheriting, the less likely you'll owe significant capital gains tax. If the property appreciates substantially while you're deciding what to do, you'll owe more in taxes when you finally sell.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Selling Inherited Property in Nashville</h2>
      
      <details>
        <summary>How do I sell an inherited house in Nashville?</summary>
        <p class="sub">To sell an inherited house in Nashville, you'll typically need to complete probate (unless the property was in a trust or had TOD provisions), obtain clear title, and choose a selling method. Selling for cash to Propcash eliminates the need for repairs, avoids agent commissions, and allows you to close quickly ‚Äî often before probate is finalized.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Can I sell an inherited house before probate in Tennessee?</summary>
        <p class="sub">Generally, you'll need probate court approval before selling. However, we can structure a sale agreement contingent on court approval, allowing you to lock in an offer while probate proceeds. We've helped many Nashville families navigate this process with their attorneys.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>Do I have to pay taxes on an inherited house in Nashville?</summary>
        <p class="sub">Tennessee has no inheritance tax. You may owe federal estate tax (only if estate exceeds $13.61M) and capital gains tax if you sell for more than the stepped-up basis value. Because of the stepped-up basis rule, most heirs who sell soon after inheriting owe little to no capital gains tax. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>What if the inherited Nashville property needs major repairs?</summary>
        <p class="sub">That's exactly why we're here. Most inherited properties need work ‚Äî it's one of the biggest burdens heirs face. We buy houses in any condition. Don't spend a penny on repairs. We'll make a fair cash offer based on the current condition and handle all renovations ourselves after purchase.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>How long does it take to sell an inherited house in Nashville?</summary>
        <p class="sub">With Propcash, once probate allows the sale, we can close in as little as 7-14 days. Traditional sales take 60-90+ days and require repairs, staging, and showings. The total timeline depends on your probate status, but we work on YOUR schedule.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>What if there are multiple heirs who inherited the Nashville property?</summary>
        <p class="sub">Multiple heirs is one of the most common scenarios we handle. A cash sale is often the cleanest solution because it provides a definitive value that can be split fairly. We can work with all parties involved and coordinate with your attorney to ensure everyone's interests are protected.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>I live out of state and inherited a Nashville property. Can you still help?</summary>
        <p class="sub">Absolutely! We work with out-of-state heirs all the time. We can conduct virtual walkthroughs, coordinate with local probate attorneys, and handle all on-the-ground details. You won't need to make multiple trips to Nashville. Many of our clients close without ever visiting the property.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details>
        <summary>What happens to the mortgage on an inherited house?</summary>
        <p class="sub">If there's an outstanding mortgage, it will be paid off from the sale proceeds at closing. We work with the mortgage servicer to obtain payoff amounts and handle everything through the title company. You'll receive the net proceeds after the mortgage is satisfied.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can you help if the inherited property has liens or back taxes?</summary>
        <p class="sub">Yes. We've handled many Nashville inherited properties with tax liens, mechanic's liens, or other encumbrances. We'll work with the title company to identify all liens and either pay them from proceeds or negotiate payoffs. We can even advance funds in certain situations.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do I need to clean out the house before selling?</summary>
        <p class="sub">No. We understand that sorting through a lifetime of belongings is emotionally exhausting. We buy properties with contents included. Take what you want, and we'll handle the rest ‚Äî furniture, personal items, everything.</p>
