# Propcash

> Real estate's first competitive marketplace for cash offers. Powered by 500+ investors nationwide.

Propcash is a real estate technology platform that operates as a cash offer marketplace, connecting home sellers with a network of 500+ verified property investors across the United States. The core value proposition is creating competition among investors to ensure sellers receive the best possible cash offers for their properties.

## How It Works

1. Sellers submit their property information through the platform
2. The property is distributed to relevant investors in the network
3. Multiple investors compete by submitting cash offers
4. Sellers receive and compare offers, choosing the best one
5. The sale closes quickly, typically in 7-14 days

## Key Benefits for Sellers

- **Speed**: Cash sales close in days, not months
- **No repairs needed**: Properties sold as-is
- **No commissions**: Sellers keep more money
- **Transparency**: See all offers and compare terms
