    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How does Propcash work?</h3>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        Propcash is a real estate marketplace that connects sellers with a network of 500+ vetted cash investors. Lookig to sell your property for cash? Just you submit your property details and we distribute it to cash investors who specialize in your area and property type. Multiple investors compete by submitting offers, which drives your price up. Our Marketplace Specialists review all offers and present you with the best option.
      </p>
    </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
       <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Is Propcash free to use?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes, Propcash is 100% free for sellers. We don't charge any fees, commissions, or hidden costs. Our revenue comes from a referral fee paid by the investor when a deal closes. 
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Am I obligated to accept an offer</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No. There is zero obligation to accept any offer you receive. If the offers don't meet your needs or expectations, you can simply walk away—no fees, no pressure, no hard feelings.
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">What information do I need to get started?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          You can get started by submitting our form with basic information about your property: address, property type, condition, and your contact information. The entire process takes about 2 minutes. We'll follow up with a few additional questions to help investors make accurate offers.

      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How quickly will I receive offers?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Most properties receive their first offer within 24 hours. Our network of 500+ investors is actively looking for properties, so response times are typically very fast. The average property receives 3+ competing offers.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How long does it take to close?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          The average closing timeline is 14 days, but we've completed transactions in as little as 3 days. The timeline is flexible and depends on your situation. Submitting your property is not an obligation to sell.
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">What happens after I submit my property?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Once you submit your property, one of our Marketplace Specialists will contact you to learn more about your situation and timeline. We then distribute the information to relevant investors in our network. As offers come in, our Marketplace Specialists reviews them for price, timeline, and investor reputation. We then present you with the best option and guide you through the decision-making process.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Can I choose my closing timeline?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. Different investors offer different closing timelines, giving you flexibility. Whether you need to close in 3 days or 90 days, we work with you to find an investor whose timeline matches your needs.

      <div class="faq-item">
     <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">What types of properties do you accept?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          We work with all residential property types: single-family homes, condos, townhomes, multi-family properties, and even land. Properties can be in any condition—from move-in ready to severe disrepair. Our investors specialize in cash only "as is" deals.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Do I need to make repairs before selling?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No. All investors in our network buy properties "as-is," meaning you don't need to make any repairs, upgrades, or improvements. They'll make offers based on the current condition of your property.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How are offers determined?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Each investor evaluates your property independently based on location, condition, market comparables, and their investment criteria. The marketplace model creates competition, which naturally drives offers higher than you'd get from a single cash buyer.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
       <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">What if I don't receive any offers?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          While this is rare, if your property doesn't receive offers within 48 hours, we'll reach out to discuss alternative options and next steps. This might include adjusting expectations, exploring different sale methods, or connecting you with local resources.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
     <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Can I list my property if it has liens or back taxes?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes. Many investors in our network specialize in properties with liens, back taxes, or other title issues. These complications are factored into their offers, and they often handle the resolution process as part of the sale.

      <div class="faq-item">
             <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Are there any fees or commissions?</h3>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          No. Sellers pay zero fees to use Propcash. Unlike traditional real estate sales (which typically cost 6% in agent commissions), our service is completely free for sellers. Investors pay a referral fee when a deal closes.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Will I pay closing costs?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          This depends on the offer. Many investors cover all closing costs as part of their offer, while others may ask you to contribute. This information will be clearly disclosed in each offer so you can compare total net proceeds.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How do cash offer deals compare to traditional sales?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Cash offers are typically lower than retail market value (usually 70-90% depending on condition), but you save 6% in agent commissions, avoid repair costs, and eliminate holding costs like mortgage payments, utilities, and insurance. For many sellers, the net proceeds are comparable—and you close much faster.

      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Who are the investors in your network?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Our network consists of 500+ vetted real estate investors, including licensed real estate investment companies, property flippers, landlords, and institutional buyers. All investors are screened for financial capacity, track record, and professionalism.

     <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Is Propcash a real estate brokerage?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          No. Propcash is a platform that connects sellers with investors. We don't act as real estate agents or brokers, and we don't provide legal, tax, or financial advice. We may acquire contractual rights to properties and assign them to investors in our network.

      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How does Propcash make money?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          We earn a referral fee from the investor when a deal closes. This fee is paid by the investor. This ensures that our incentives are aligned with sellers. We want to help you get the best possible offer because we only succeed when you do.

      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">How is Propcash better than a local "we buy houses" company?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
         Propcash creates competition for your property by sending it to our national network of accredited cash investors, helping create better offers for your property.
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Should I just list with my property with an agent?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          It depends on your situation. Traditional listings work well if you have time (3-6 months), your property is in good condition, and you can handle showings and repairs. Propcash is designed to help sellers who value speed, want to avoid repairs, or can't wait for buyer financing. 
        </p>

      <div class="faq-item">
     <h3 class="faq-question" style="font-weight: 700; color: #6b4423;">Can I list on Propcash and with an agent at the same time?</h3>

        <p class="faq-answer">
          Yes, as long as you haven't signed an exclusive listing agreement with an agent. Many sellers explore both options to see which yields better results. Just make sure you're transparent with all parties involved.
